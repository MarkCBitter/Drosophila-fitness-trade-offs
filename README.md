#Drosophila fitness trade-offs
Repository of code for experiments assessing presence of fitness trade-offs using large, experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster.

The study consisted of two experiments:
1) An indoor experimental evolution study using four outbred, replicate popultions of the DGRP (http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu/data.html) whereby replicate popultions underwent sustained repredocution selection for nine, non-overlapping generations and a single bout of stress-tolerance, truncations selection. 
2) A paired indoor/outdoor mesocosm used to test whether SNPs identified via reproduction selection in an environmentally-controlled, lab setting displayed signals of selection and trade-offs in an outdoor mesocosm exposed to natural enviornmental fluctuations. Outdoor mesocosm data for this experiment were previously described and published by Bitter et al. 2024 (10.1038/s41586-024-07834-x).

This repository contains code for the analysis of allele frequency data from each of those experiments.

Sequencing data from the DGRP lines used in the population expansion/truncation experiment are publicly available at http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu/data.html.  Haplotype-informed allele frequency estimates from evolved, outbred samples and used in statistical analysis will be available at upon article publication. Founder line sequences for the paired indoor/outdoor mesocosm study are available at NCBI Accession PRJNA722305. Outdoor mesocosm sequences generated via pooled sequencing for this experiment are available at NCBI accession PRJNA1031645 and alle frequency data is available at the following Dryad repository: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xd2547dpv. Indoor sequences and allele frequency data will be available upon article publication.
